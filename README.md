# Instructions

1. `git clone https://github.com/KevinCPP/ma321-proj2`
2. navigate to the repo directory
3. run `python3 main.py` (or possibly just `python main.py` depending on your setup)

# Project Structure

The two portions of this code, the root finding methods and the interpolation methods, are packaged into modules. Each module has a demo function which tests each method within. Running main.py basically just runs the demo function for both root finding methods and interpolation methods.
